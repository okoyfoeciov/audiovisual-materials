/**
 * Dictation — session selection & grading.
 *
 * Three pieces:
 *   1. Turning a transcript's per-word array into short audio sessions, cut at
 *      boundaries the SPEAKER produced (terminal punctuation confirmed by a
 *      pause, or a pause on its own) rather than at boundaries the ASR guessed.
 *   2. A scheduler that spaces items, re-exposes what was failed, and aims at a
 *      success band — instead of retiring every item on first sight.
 *   3. A WER-based checker that scores the learner, not the transcriber.
 *
 * Design notes
 * ────────────
 * WER is defined everywhere as (S + D + I) / N, where S = substitutions,
 * D = deletions, I = insertions, N = words in reference. Accuracy is reported
 * as max(0, 1 - WER), clamped because insertions can push WER > 1.
 *
 * The normalisation applied before alignment is deliberately NOT the ASR
 * benchmark recipe. A benchmark wants to forgive everything that isn't a
 * recognition error; a dictation drill wants to forgive everything that isn't a
 * LISTENING error, and those are different sets:
 *
 *   - Contractions stay whole tokens, so "we're" heard as "were" is scored as
 *     the error it is. (An earlier version deleted apostrophes before
 *     tokenising, which made every contraction/homophone confusion — the single
 *     thing this drill exists to train, per Field 2008 — score 100%.)
 *   - Expansions are free: "it is" typed for "it's" canonicalises to the same
 *     token, because writing the long form proves you decoded the short one.
 *   - Possessive 's is folded away for ordinary nouns ("America's" == "Americas")
 *     since it is not audible, but NOT for the pronoun contractions where 's is
 *     "is"/"has".
 *   - Numbers, currency and percent are canonicalised to a numeric form on both
 *     sides, so "thirty million dollars" == "$30 million". This is the step
 *     Whisper's own EnglishTextNormalizer exists to provide (Radford et al.
 *     2023, App. C).
 *
 * Segmentation cuts on PAUSES, not on ASR punctuation. Published period
 * restoration on ASR output tops out around F1 82 and commas around 62-66, so
 * punctuation alone is a boundary signal that is wrong roughly one time in five;
 * the word timings are already in the transcript and are not a guess. A gap
 * larger than HARD_GAP_S is a hard boundary that no session may straddle, which
 * is what stops a session spanning speech the ASR dropped entirely.
 *
 * Scheduling follows the retrieval-practice literature rather than a
 * seen/unseen bit: SM-2 intervals (Woźniak) over an append-only attempt log,
 * candidate scoring after Papoušek & Pelánek (2015), a success target between
 * Wilson et al. (2019) and Papoušek's deployed 0.75, and Rawson & Dunlosky's
 * 3-correct criterion before an item retires. Failing an item re-queues it;
 * it does not burn it.
